Hello there ðŸ‘‹, in this article, we'll be going to cover some basic commands used to navigate through the Command Line Interface (CLI).

Before we dive further into the commands let's first understand what the term CLI means.

## What's the Command Line Interface

## Terms to Note
- Directory:
- Root Directory: this is the first or top-most directory in a hierarchy. 

## Basic Commands
Hopefully, by now, we understood what's the CLI is all about, so now let's go over some of the basic commands we can use to navigate through the CLI

### Change Directory (`cd`)

The command `cd` meaning change directory is used to move from one directory or folder ðŸ“‚  to another just like the name say.

> I'll keep using the world directory in this article cause it's kinda the technical term for folders, but essentially all it means is just a Folder.

Let's say you have a file structure like this:

```bash
User
   |-- Desktop
   |-- Videos
   |
```
> Let's assume the `User` folder in the file structure snippet above is the root directory of a computer.

```bash
User ~
$
```

```bash
cd Desktop
```
