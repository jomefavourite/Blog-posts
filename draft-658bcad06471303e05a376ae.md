## Introduction

Ever spent hours wrestling with images that refuse to stay put in your web layouts? You're not alone. Centering images in CSS can be a challenging task, riddled with unexpected quirks and browser inconsistencies. But fear not, weary web warrior! This session is your guide to demystifying the jungle of image centering methods. We’ll go over 5 methods that can be used to center images.

## Methods of Centering Images in CSS

There are different methods of centering Images in CSS, we'll cover five major methods in this article, which are:

* Using text-align Property.
    
* Using Margin Property.
    
* Using Flexbox Property.
    
* Using Grid Property.
    
* Using the Position Property.
    

## **Method 1: Using text-align property to center an image**

The **text-align** property, although primarily designed for text alignment, can also be a quick and straightforward method to center images horizontally within their container. By applying **text-align: center** to the container, you leverage its alignment capabilities to achieve a centered image without complex CSS rules.

However, this method will only work when the image is wrapped in a block-level container such as a div element, and then on the parent component, the text-align property is used.

Here is a code snippet that shows how to use the text-align property:

```html
<!-- HTML file -->
<body>
    <h1>Centering an Image with CSS</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="https://buffer.com/library/content/images/size/w1200/2023/10/free-images.jpg" width="300">
    </div>
</body>
```

```css
/* CSS file */
.container{
   text-align: center;
}

.container img {
   /* Additional styles for the image, if needed */
}
```

### Limitation using the text-align property

However, there are some limitations when using the **text-align** property for centering images:

* **Issue of container width**: If the container has a specified width and the image is wider than the container, it won't be centered. In such cases, you might need to ensure that the container is wide enough to accommodate the image.
    
* **Issue of Vertical Alignment:** The **text-align** property only handles horizontal alignment. If you need to vertically center the image, you might need additional techniques, such as using flexbox or CSS Grid which will be discussed soon.
    

## Method 2: Using Margin property **to center an image**

The **margin** property can be used to center an image horizontally within it’s container (parent element). By setting the left and right margins to **auto** and using **text-align: center** as a complementary measure for older versions of Internet Explorer, this method provides a reliable way to achieve image centering.

Here is a code snippet that shows how to use the margin property:

```html
<!-- HTML file -->
<div class="container">
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1660866838821-0c12213703df?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1yZWxhdGVkfDEyfHx8ZW58MHx8fHx8&w=1000&q=80" width="500" alt="Centered Image">
</div>
```

```css
/* CSS file */
.container {
  text-align: center; /* For older versions of IE */
}

.container img {
  display: block; /* Ensures block-level behavior for margins */
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  /* Additional styles for the image, if needed */
}
```

**Explanation of the above code:**

* **text-align: center** is used on the container to ensure compatibility with older versions of Internet Explorer. It’s a good practice to add this property in the parent container, but the margin property is well-supported across major browsers now.
    
* **display: block** is applied to the image to make it a block-level element, allowing the use of auto margins.
    
* **margin-left: auto** and **margin-right: auto** set the left and right margins to auto, effectively centering the image horizontally.
    

### Limitation of using the margin property

* **Horizontal Centering Only:** The primary limitation of using **margin** for centering is that it only handles horizontal centering. If vertical centering is required, additional techniques or properties need to be employed.
    
* **Requires a Defined Width:** The margin: auto; trick relies on the image having a specific width set. Without a defined width, the browser won't have a clear reference for distributing the margins evenly. This can sometimes limit layout flexibility if you need the image to adjust its width dynamically.
    
* **Not Ideal for Responsive Design:** While **margin** can be effective for fixed-width layouts, it may not be the best choice for responsive designs. For responsive centering, techniques like Flexbox or CSS Grid are often preferred.
    

## Method 3: Using Flexbox property **to center an image**

Flexbox provides a powerful and flexible layout model, making it an excellent choice for centering elements, including images, both horizontally and vertically. By applying the **display: flex;** property to the container and using alignment properties, you can achieve precise control over the positioning of your images.

Now, let’s see how to position an image to the center using Flexbox both Horizontally and Vertically.

### Horizontal Centering with Flexbox

Here's how you can achieve horizontal centering using Flexbox:

```css
<!-- HTML file -->
<div class="container">
  <img src="https://buffer.com/library/content/images/size/w1200/2023/10/free-images.jpg" width="500">
</div>
```

```css
/* CSS file */
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  /* Additional styles for the container, if needed */
}

.container img {
  /* Additional styles for the image, if needed */
}
```

**Preview:**

![](https://images.surferseo.art/c5bf4650-e4b5-4af5-a899-b8a1a4e96312.png align="left")

**Explanation:**

* **display: flex;** is applied to the container, turning it into a flex container.
    
* **justify-content: center;** horizontally centers the image within the container.
    
* Additional styles for the container and image can be adjusted based on design requirements.
    

### Vertical Centering with Flexbox

Here's how you can achieve vertical centering of an image using Flexbox:

```bash
<!-- HTML file -->
<div class="container">
  <img src="https://buffer.com/library/content/images/size/w1200/2023/10/free-images.jpg" width="500">
</div>
```

```bash
/* CSS file */
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 80vh;
  /* Additional styles for the container, if needed */
}

.container img {
  /* Additional styles for the image, if needed */
}
```

**Preview:**

**Explanation:**

All that's different from the horizontal centering of an image is that the container element has these properties **align-items** and a **fixed height**.

* **align-items: center;** vertically centers the image within the container.
    
* **height;** this property is needed so that the image would be positioned vertically, in the example above 80vh was used but it could be any length value as far as it's greater than the height of the image.
