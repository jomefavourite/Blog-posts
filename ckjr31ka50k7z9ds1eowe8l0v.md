Hi there üëã, I've decided to take 2 weeks off coding and here are my reasons...

Before getting to my reason, allow me to run through what I've been doing for some couple of months last year, 2020. For the past 3 months - (September - December), I've challenged myself by coding every single day partaking in the challenge called __#100DaysOfCode__ where you code for at least an hour every day.

I started ***Sep 15th 2020*** and completed the challenge ***Dec 25th 2020***, from my calculation I did 2 days extra of the challenge, how come you may ask üòâ?

Well, I miss calculated Day 7Ô∏è‚É£ and 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ and redid those two days unknown to me till now.

> I didn't want to know the date of completing the challenge in mind as to not wonder if I'll be able to complete it.

Also, why have I decided to only take two weeks away from coding, well I've got big plans this year (2020) and I wouldn't want to take a long break that'll make me forget every programming üôÉ.

So I stumbled upon this video, by the one and only [@Kyle Cook](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) where he talked about the various reasons why developers get burnout and how the to prevent burnout, also most importantly how programming less could be a big game-changer to your productivity later on. The video made me realise I haven't been engaged in other activities aside from tech-related stuff.

## So here's my reason for the break:

__1. Family Time__

Even though I completed the challenge, I still did code related stuff almost every day afterwards, whenever I got bored, I programmed, neglecting some of my chores at home and having less family time.

My parents have been supportive but I know they're sometimes angry with me because I've not been partaking in some activities and I'm the first child üôÑ. Well, I hope to balance my life coding and doing other activities too. 

That's why I'll like to spend more time with my parents and siblings assisting to the best of my abilities (I plan to make this a continuous habit not just a two weeks thing üôè).

__2. Improvement time__

I've decided to read books, as to broaden my horizon this year 2021. Books that aren't necessarily programming related, then I noticed people publicly announcing that they'll be reading this and this books for the time being and also one of those books which were mentioned is: __Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear__ and from the Topic alone, it spoke to me that I needed to read the book as I didn't even have a series of books in mind to read anyways.

Sadly since when I announced publicly I'll be reading the book I haven't read a single page, why?

Well, there's no just reason why I haven't read a single page yet but I will definitely start from the first week of the break and hopefully complete the book (not in two weeks obviously).

__3. Study Time__

I've been so engrossed doing the challenge for the past 3 months also neglecting some school works.

I plan to start reading my school notes and get ready for resumption.

### Conclusion 

I feel two weeks is enough to initialise my plans for the new year and also I'll try to be less active on all Social Media because I don't think I'll be able to abstain myself completely üòë.

I'll probably write a follow-up article or not. Who knows... üëÄ

Have a wonderful day and remember to take breaks also.<br />
