Luckily, in the year 2021, the Hackathon was made virtual so as for anyone to participate, which was held through the weekend from 30th Oct to 31st Oct.

There were three themes for the Hackathon and each team were to pick a particular theme/challenge they'll like to solve and start coming up with ideas related to their pick.

- Build a tool that helps African youth get access to remote job opportunities.
- Build a tool that makes education more accessible.
- Build a tool that helps the Next Billion User (NBU) businesses.
