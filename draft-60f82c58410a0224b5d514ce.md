It's also a way of thinking/seeing a world view of think.

Functional Programming is all about one concept which is Pure Function. 

Pure Functions takes an input then performs some operations and returns an outputs based on it's input.

That might be hard to comprehend, so here's an example differentiating Pure Functions from Impure Function.

**Pure Function**
```js
function isCooking(food) {
  return `Mum is cooking ${food}`
}

isCooking('Rice') // Mum is cooking Rice

isCooking('Beans') // Mum is cooking Beans
```

**Impure Function**
```js
let food = 'Rice'
function isCooking() {
  console.log(`Mum is cooking ${food}`)
}

isCooking() // Mum is cooking Rice

food = "Beans"
isCooking() // Mum is cooking Beans
```

Pure Function are **deterministic**, meaning the output is dependent on it's input so as far as the argument passed to the Function doesn't change you'll have the same result.
