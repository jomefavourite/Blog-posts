React Server Components (RSC) is the latest and shining architectural design in React. It comes with some new patterns, like server actions and directives—"use client" and "use sever" with the goal of allowing us developers to offload some processes that can be done on the client side to the server side, improving performance and developer experience when building web applications.

However, learning a new architecture or pattern can be interesting (not in most cases 😏), but it's important to understand the why behind the new. What was wrong with the previous method, and what benefits does the new architectural paradigm bring to the table?

In this article, we'll discuss the why and benefits of React Server Components.

> This article was inspired by [Dan Abramov's talk for React Conf 2024 - React for Two Computers.](https://www.youtube.com/live/T8TZQ6k4SLE?t=18825s)

## React for Two Computers

Dan Abramov, one of the prominent figures in the React ecosystem, gave a talk titled **React for Two Computers**, where the new pattern of how React Server Components work was simplified with the concept of thinking about the Server and Client as two computers in a program powered by React.

In essence, React components can now run on the server, which is really cool, but without adding interactivity (more on this later on). Before the concept of React Server Components (RSC), we had various ways for the client computer to make requests to the server, like Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Client-side Rendering (CSR) requests, but let's find out why is cool by understanding the previous methods.

However, the general idea was that both computers would be in two different locations, communicating with each other, but with RSC, this communication is much closer.

## Client Side Rendering (CSR)

Client-side Rendering is the traditional way React has always worked, where there would be two separate computers in communication over the network.

1. The client computer (React application)
    
2. The server computer
    

The React application (Client computer) either makes use of the `useEffect` hook, or data-fetching libraries like Tanstack Query or Apollo to make some requests to the server computer to get some data.

```javascript
// React application
function Page({page}) {
  const [content, setContent] = useState('');
  // NOTE: loads *after* first page render.
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/content/${page}`).then((data) => {
      setContent(data.content);
    });
  }, [page]);
  
  return <div>{sanitizeHtml(marked(content))}</div>;
}
```

```javascript
// Server - API
app.get(`/api/content/:page`, async (req, res) => {
  const page = req.params.page;
  const content = await file.readFile(`${page}.md`);
  res.send({content});
});
```

## **Server and Client Components**

Next.js 14 leverages React Server Components, which offer a new way to build applications that combine the benefits of server-side rendering with the interactivity of client-side apps. Understanding the difference between Server and Client Components is crucial for optimizing your Next.js application.

**Explaining the Difference**

**Server Components:**

* Render on the server
    
* Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client
    
* Can directly access backend resources
    
* Cannot use browser-only APIs or React hooks
    

**Client Components:**

* Render on the client (browser)
    
* Enable interactivity and use of React hooks
    
* Can access browser APIs
    
* Increase the JavaScript bundle size
    

## React Sever Components

#### When to Use Each Type

## Conclusion

**Use Server Components for:**

* Fetching data
    
* Accessing backend resources directly
    
* Keeping sensitive information on the server
    
* Large dependencies that don't need client-side interactivity
    

**Use Client Components for:**

* Interactivity and event listeners
    
* Using React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
    
* Browser-only APIs
    
* Custom hooks that depend on state or effects
