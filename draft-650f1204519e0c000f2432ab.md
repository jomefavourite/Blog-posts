Folder structure is one of those things, we developers would have to think about at some point while working on a project. This article isn't about how to structure folders, but how to use the Next.js App router folder structure while using React.js with Vite and the help of React Router.

## Prerequisites

* Basic Git and Github knowledge
    
* React.js fundamentals understood
    
* Basic understanding of Next.js router structure
    

## TLDR

But why would you want to have a React.js app, structured as a Next.js app?

In my use case at my place of work, we had a monorepo using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) with two Next.js applications, one a landing page and the other a dashboard. Due to the files, dependencies and growth of the dashboard, the development experience (DX) got painfully bearing while using the App router, changes took a long time to reflect on the browser.

So my colleague (William) did something cool. He moved the entire codebase from Next.js to Vite, while maintaining the folder structure. After the migration the DX problem we were facing was gone, also the Dashboard doesn't really need all the fancy things Next.js provides, so it was a no-brainer decision.

After going over the codebase to understand what he did, I decided to migrate my [Portfolio website](https://www.favouritejome.site/) to Vite, while maintaining the folder structure of Next.js app router just for fun.

## Migrate from Next.js app router to Vite

In this article, I'll be working through the process of how the migration of my portfolio website went from using Next.js app router to using Vite. Though Vite powers the React app, it isn't the responsible for the migration, what's responsible for maintaining the folder structure, is [React Router V6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

To follow along with this article, you'd need to clone the portfolio website [here](https://github.com/jomefavourite/portfolio-v2/tree/blog-starter) and move to the `blog-starter` branch, which is where we'll start the migration.

The `blog-starter` branch comes with a Next.js project, so the first thing we'll need to do is initiate a Vite project. To do this run the command below and select React for the framework, while Typescript as the variant.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Now, you should have a folder created, called `vite-project` among the other files, but the folder isn't really needed, so we'll be moving the Vite specific things out of the folder into the root folder later on.

At this point, you'd need to delete all the Next.js related files, like the `.eslintrc.json` `.gitignore`, `next.config.js`, `package-lock.json`, `.hintrc` from the root directory and move the files `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.gitignore`, `index.html` from the `vite-project` folder to the root folder.

The `tsconfig.json` file in the `vite-project` needs to be modified with:

```bash
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./app/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["app"],
  ....
}
```

> Note include key has the value as \["app"\] and not \["src"\], this is because we'll be using the app directory as our entry point to the codebase, instead of the traditional `src` directory, Vite makes use of by default.
