* Useful when solving a problem, such as advent of code puzzle
    

While coding, most time, our first priority is to get our code to run as we expect, to solve a given task or bug. And upon doing so, we may introduce several data structures like arrays, strings, objects, numbers etc. (at least in the land of JavaScript, for example), manipulating them to get the desired results we seek.

After getting our desired result, we might forget about optimizing the code further; cause, after all, it does work üòè, I'm definitely guilty of this, and you properly are too, so let's look into data structures, as they could be used to optimize and make our code structure more efficient when used to solve a task.

Are you making use of the right Data Structure?

Well, that's a tough question, and I don't have the answer; this is because we all face different challenges while coding, so the point of this article is bring to your awareness the conscious fact that you may be solving a given problem in an efficient way, also with several examples.

When we hear the word Data Structure, we think, oh, it just a way for us to store data. Then
