Many web programs provide drag-and-drop capabilities, which allow users to effortlessly rearrange or move objects between lists. React drag-and-drop, popularly known as React DnD, is a popular framework for implementing this functionality in React. It offers a collection of abstractions and components to manage complicated drag-and-drop behavior.

In this article, we’ll look at how to make use of React DnD to provide drag and drop capabilities in a React project. We’ll begin by creating a new project and install the required dependencies, then proceed to develop a basic drag-and-drop application. We’ll also go over some of the benefits and drawbacks of using React DnD, as well as some typical mistakes to avoid throughout implementation.

## Understanding the Drag and Drop Concept

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709498563265/ae92c99f-0531-4eac-8053-3af254a8df60.gif align="left")

In the realm of user interfaces (UI), drag and drop transcends mere web aesthetics. It’s a powerful interaction paradigm that empowers a user to:

* **Effortlessly move and reorder items:** Whether it’s rearranging tasks in a to-do list, reordering photos in a gallery, or organizing files in a folder, drag and drop provides an intuitive way to manipulate elements within an interface.
    
* **Simplify complex tasks:** Uploading files becomes a breeze with drag and drop, eliminating the need for cumbersome navigation through menus and file selection dialogues.
    
* **Enhance user experience:** The intuitive nature of drag and drop fosters a sense of control and ease, ultimately leading to a more enjoyable and efficient interaction with your application.

Imagine viewing an online photo album and easily rearranging photographs by dragging and dropping them into a new order. If you have used project management websites, design websites or website builders, you must have observed the drag and drop feature they incorporate. Example of websites that utilize drag and drop are Trello, Pinterest, Canva, and Wix.

For better understanding, let’s look at a breakdown of the drag and drop concept by looking at the core mechanisms of [React Dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/) using the online photo album analogy.

## Photo Album Analogy

**Drag and drop interactions are based on the browser’s built-in HTML5 Drag and Drop API.** This API serves as the the platform, that gives events such as dragstart, dragover, and drop the signal to begin, progress, and complete a drag and drop action.

**React DnD serves as an interface, connecting the browser API to your React component.** It carefully watches for these drag and drop occurrences by placing event listeners on certain photo elements in your album. These events, like gentle nudges, execute callbacks set within your component using hooks like useDrag and useDrop.

**When you drag a photo, information about it is bundled and attached to the drag event via the dataTransfer object.** Picture this process as a baton pass; React DnD intercepts this data to ensure that everyone involved in the interaction (your components) understands which photo is being dragged.

**To offer visual clues throughout the interaction, React DnD employs DOM manipulation techniques.** Imagine dimming the dragged photo slightly as you move it or indicating the drop target region when hovering over it. These visual effects are coordinated by DOM manipulation, resulting in an intuitive user experience.

**As you move the photo to a new location, React DnD components update the application’s state based on the events and your actions.** This status update reflects changes in your online album, such as rearranging photographs or moving them to a certain album section. Basically, the state update saves the score, guaranteeing that your album matches the most recent arrangement.

Now that we have an understanding of these operations, we can proceed to explore the full potential of React DnD and develop intuitive and engaging interactions for our websites.

## Introduction to React Drag and Drop

By now, we have sure gotten a grasp of what React Dnd is about. We’ve seen that it is an open-source library for adding drag-and-drop capabilities to React applications. It also provides abstractions and components for complicated drag-and-drop behavior, making it easier to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709498566477/9d7ed9bc-263e-4615-8850-d6e7a4e631ef.png align="left")

Its major features are:

* Its drag sources and drop targets features
    
    which will allow us to create custom drag sources and drop targets, tailoring them to our specific needs.
    
* Its customization capabilities that allows us to design a preview that perfectly reflects the item, enhancing clarity for users of our application.
    
* Its touch-friendly interactions since it is optimized for both desktop and touch-based devices, ensuring the drag-and-drop features work flawlessly on any platform.
    
* Its many drag and drop effects allowing us to specify the desired behavior upon dropping an item and provide informative feedback throughout the drag operation.
    

These are the few features will talk about. As we progress, we’ll get to cover the others. It’s time to get our fingers dirty!

## Setting Up a Project

### 1\. Project Initialization

**Create a new React project:** Bootstrap a new react project with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

**Navigate to your project directory:** Once the project is set up, navigate/cd to the project directory using your terminal.

For the examples in this article, we’ll be setting up our project with Vite and we’ll be working on an intuitive photo gallery website. We are going to turn the images in our gallery into draggable elements. We can drag and drop images on another section of the website. We’ll also be implementing drag and drop for mobile devices.

```javascript
npm create vite@latest
```

You’ll be prompted to enter your project name.

Select the React framework and then select JavaScript. After this, a folder is created. **Cd** into the folder and run:

npm install

This adds the node\_modules folder with its dependencies. Your folder structure should look like this:

![Initial Folder Structure](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709498568031/7cc4888e-1bb4-4c34-b421-2ad24ad46d66.png align="left")

### 2\. Installing Necessary Packages

Next, we’ll install React dnd.

The core functionality of react dnd requires two packages which we’ve partially covered them till now.

npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend

**react-dnd-html5-backend** is the second package and it serves as the backend for the React dnd package, enabling browser-level support for drag and drop functionality through the HTML5 Drag and Drop API. React dnd provides the essential components and hooks for building drag and drop interactions within our React apps.

### 3\. Clean up unwanted files and default code

If you’re familiar with setting up React projects then you agree with me that we need to do a little clean up. We’ll proceed to clean up our App.js and App.css files and import the libraries we installed. Our **App.jsx** file should look like this:

/*App.jsx*/

import React from 'react'; import { DndProvider, useDrag, useDrop } from 'react-dnd'; import { HTML5Backend } from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';

const App = () =&gt; { return ( &lt;&gt; {/*our components will be here*/} //to be replaced with the Gallery.jsx component &lt;/&gt; ) }

export default App

I know, I know, we’ve not started building our project and we’re already importing and writing a bunch of code! I’ll explain each line of code I added.

import { DndProvider, useDrag, useDrop } from 'react-dnd';

On this line, we’re importing DndProvider, useDrag and useDrop hooks from the react dnd library.

**DndProvider** is a component that comes with react-dnd. It wraps our application’s content and provides the necessary context for drag and drop functionality to work seamlessly.

**useDrag and useDrop** are hooks, also from the react-dnd library, used within react components to define draggable elements and drop targets, respectively.

import { HTML5Backend } from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';

On this line, we’re importing HTML5Backend from the react-dnd-html5-backend.

**HTML5Backend:** is a component that specifies the backend we’re using which is HTML5 Drag and Drop API in this case.

{/*our components will be here*/}

### Importance of DnDProvider

On these lines of code, we’re wrapping our React components with the **DndProvider** component and passing **HTML5Backend** as a prop. Its like the central hub for managing drag and drop functionality. It plays the following very important roles:

* **It works as a context provider**, providing all child components nested within it with necessary information for drag and drop operations.
    
* **It will act as a link between our application and the HTML5 drag and drop API backend we’ll be using**. In order to manage browser-level events like dragstart, dragover, and drop, it communicates with the backend and initiates them when necessary while dragging and dropping objects.
    
* **It maintains the global state of the dragging and dropping interaction**, including details about the currently dragged object and the presently dropped target, in order to carry out global state management. This shared state makes it possible for any child component of the DndProvider to obtain and make use of a specific data on the current interaction.
    
* **It manages the application’s drag and drop lifecycle as a whole**. It performs callbacks that are defined using DnD hooks  at different points throughout the interaction (e.g., when an item is dropped, begins to be dragged, or hovers over a drop target).
    

With these explained, let’s go over to the fun part where we start building our image gallery project.

## Building a Project

We’ll start by creating an array of objects representing our image gallery. We’ll be using random images.

const images = \[ { id: 1, src: 'flower.jpg', title: 'Image 1' }, { id: 2, src: 'cat.jpg', title: 'Image 2' }, { id: 3, src: 'dog.jpg', title: 'Image 2' }, // ... add as many as you want \];

### Creating our components

We’ll be creating two new components:  
**Gallery**: Container component for the entire gallery with logic for managing image data and updating state.

**DraggableImage**: Component representing each individual image, responsible for handling drag and drop events, and rendering the image.

### Implementing our DnD application

We’re going to start by mapping through our images in the **Gallery.jsx** component, and then pass the props(src, title, and id) to the **DraggableImage** component:

/*Gallery.jsx*/

{Images.map((image) =&gt; (

))}

Next, in our **DraggableImage.jsx** component, we’ll destructure the props and use them in an **img** tag.

/*DraggableImage.jsx*/

const DraggableImage = ({ src, title, id }) =&gt; { return(

![{title}](%7Bsrc%7D align="left")

) }

We’ll be using the **id** prop soon.

### useDrag hook

Next, we’ll use the **useDrag** hook to make each image a draggable item:

import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd';

... const \[{ isDragging }, drag\] = useDrag(() =&gt; ({ type: 'image', collect: (monitor) =&gt; ({ isDragging: !!monitor.isDragging, }), }));

**type** and **collect** are properties that come from the useDrag hook.

**type: ‘image’**: Specifies the type of data being dragged, which is “image.” Note that “image” can be any other string like “photo” or whatever meaningful name you think of. Its only used to specify the type property.

**collect: (monitor) =&gt; ({ isDragging: !!monitor.isDragging })**: is a function that gathers information about the dragging state. It inverts the **monitor.isDragging** value, setting **isDragging** to true only when the image is not already being dragged.

To make our image draggable, we’ll have to add the drag prop from the hook as a ref on the **img** element.

![{title}](%7Bsrc%7D align="left")

Furthermore, we’ll use the **isDragging** prop from the drag hook to style the image when it is dragged:

&lt;img ... style={{ border: isDragging ? '3px solid brown' : '0px', }} /&gt;

### Droppable Interface

In our **Gallery.jsx** file, we’ll add a new div for the droppable interface (our album). Our goal is to be able to drag our image and drop it on another div or section of our screen which serves as our album.

/*Gallery.jsx*/

## Album

Next, we’ll add a state for the album using react **useState** hook. It holds an array to store the currently dragged item.

import React, { useState } from 'react'; const Gallery = () =&gt; { const \[album, setAlbum\] = useState(\[\]); ... }

Just as we mapped through the **images** array, we’ll map through the album array so that the currently dropped image is shown here. Similarly, we’ll pass the props from the album array to the **DraggableImage** component.

## Album

{album.map((image) =&gt; ( ))}

### Making Images Droppable

Now, we’ll work on making our images droppable using the useDrop hook. It will define a drop target within the album area.

import { useDrop } from 'react-dnd';

The useDrop hook also provides properties that we can use to make our images draggable items.

const \[{ isOver }, drop\] = useDrop(() =&gt; ({ accept: 'image', drop: (item) =&gt; addImageToAlbum(item.id), collect: (monitor) =&gt; ({ isOver: !!monitor.isOver, }), }));

* **accept: ‘image’:** Specifies that this drop target only accepts items of type “image”, because we specified type as image previously in the DraggableImage component.
    
* **drop: (item) =&gt; addImageToAlbum(item.id):** this function is triggered when an image is dropped on the target. It has access to the id of every image therefore, it calls the **addImageToAlbum** function (which we’ll see soon), passing the image **id**.
    
* **collect: (monitor) =&gt; ({ isOver: !!monitor.isOver }):** this function gathers information about the drop target state. It checks if the drop target is currently being hovered over by an image and sets the isOver state accordingly.
    

Now, we need to add the drop function as a ref on the album’s div.

... &lt;/div

The **addImageToAlbum** function filters the Images array to find the image with the provided id. It then updates the album state with the filtered image array, essentially adding the image to the Album.

const addImageToAlbum = (id) =&gt; { const images = Images.filter((image) =&gt; id === image.id); setAlbum(\[images\[0\]\]); };

In the **DraggableImage.jsx** file, we’ll pass the **id** prop to the drag hooks’ item property to specify the data being dragged. Now, both the drag and drop hooks will have access to the id of the image being dragged or dropped. Our updated code should look like this:

const \[{ isDragging }, drag\] = useDrag(() =&gt; ({ type: 'image', item: { id: id }, //item property collect: (monitor) =&gt; ({ isDragging: !monitor.isDragging, }), }));

### Dnd Project Logic

With this, we’ve completed our online image gallery project! Let’s recall the logic of our DnD project.

* The **App.jsx** component wraps the **DndProvider** around the **Gallery.jsx** component to ensure that all components within the App component have access to the functionalities provided by React DnD, including drag and drop context and hooks like **useDrag** and **useDrop**
    
* The Gallery component renders the available images as **DraggableImage** components within the “Images” section.
    
* When a user drags an image and drops it onto the “Album” section, the **useDrop** hook triggers the **addImageToAlbum** function, adding the selected image to the album state. This state update then re-renders the “Album” section, displaying the newly added image.
    
* The **DraggableImage** component uses the **isDragging** state to visually indicate when an image is being dragged by applying a border style.
    

Below is the complete code for the Gallery and DraggableImage components:

/*Gallery.jsx*/ import React, { useState } from 'react'; import DraggableImage from './DraggableImage'; import { useDrop } from 'react-dnd'; const Gallery = () =&gt; { const \[album, setAlbum\] = useState(\[\]); const \[{ isOver }, drop\] = useDrop(() =&gt; ({ accept: 'image', drop: (item) =&gt; addImageToAlbum(item.id), collect: (monitor) =&gt; ({ isOver: !!monitor.isOver, }), })); const addImageToAlbum = (id) =&gt; { const images = Images.filter((image) =&gt; id === image.id); setAlbum(\[images\[0\]\]); }; return (

## Images

{Images.map((image) =&gt; ( ))}

## Album

{album.map((image) =&gt; ( ))}

); }; export default Gallery;

/*DraggableImage.jsx*/ import React from 'react'; import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd'; const DraggableImage = ({ src, title, id }) =&gt; { const \[{ isDragging }, drag\] = useDrag(() =&gt; ({ type: 'image', item: { id: id }, collect: (monitor) =&gt; ({ isDragging: !monitor.isDragging, }), })); return ( &lt;&gt; &lt;img ref={drag} src={src} alt={title} key={id} style={{ border: isDragging ? '3px solid brown' : '0px', width: '100%', height: '100%', borderRadius: '10px', cursor: 'grab' }} /&gt; &lt;/&gt; ); }; export default DraggableImage;

Our application should look like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709498571291/e91046ab-cb10-413c-bc73-0ad8369e0fea.webp align="left")

## Touch Devices

While there is a mobile version for mobile devices, dragging won’t feel very natural; it only updates instead of providing a satisfying draggable experience. However, using the **react-dnd-touch-backend** library, we can make it work on our mobile devices.

npm i react-dnd-touch-backend

Next, we’ll check if the device is a mobile device or if it has touch support.

In **App.jsx**;

const isDeviceTouch = () =&gt; { if ("ontouchstart" in window) { return true; } return false; };

Next, we’ll import the **TouchBackend** function and use the **isDeviceTouch** method to return the **TouchBackend** function if the device is a touch device or return the **HTML5Backend** function if its not.

import TouchBackend from "react-dnd-touch-backend";

const DNDBackend = isDeviceTouch() ? TouchBackend : HTML5Backend;

Now, we’ll replace the backend prop with DNDBackend.

This solves the mobile device drag and drop limitation.
